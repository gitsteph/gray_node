### Contributors

Many talented instructors contributed to the Immersive curriculum over the years.  For the Node curriculum, I'd like to especially acknowledge the contributions of [Rachel Waterhouse](https://github.com/rose-water) and [Mark Hellar](https://github.com/mhellar), the two Node instructors before me who helped define the content covered in this section.
